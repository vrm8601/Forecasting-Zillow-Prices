Forecasting the Median Sale Price of Homes in Philadelphia, PA

## Abstract

Zillow is an American online real estate database company that houses an abundance of useful data. Housing prices are notoriously difficult to forecast and typically involve trend and seasonality which need to be dealt with. For this reason, I thought using Zillow data would be a great learning experience for my final project to apply everything we have learned throughout this course. The dataset used in this analysis includes the raw median sale prices for all homes and is grouped by major cities in the U.S. Zillow defines “all homes” as single-family, condominium, and co-operative homes with a county record. The data is monthly and includes prices from February, 2008 to July, 2020. This project focuses on forecasting the median sale price for Philadelphia, PA since that is the city closest to where I grew up. Zillow provides smoothed and seasonally adjusted data, however, I thought using the raw values would allow me to apply decomposition myself. The goal of this project is to apply the models that I have learned throughout this course and determine which model produces the most accurate forecast.

The code for this project can be found in this repository (Code.Rmd) as well as the final report.
